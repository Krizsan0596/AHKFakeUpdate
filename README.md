# AHKFakeUpdate
This is a simple script which opens Internet Explorer, opens a [fake windows update screen](https://fakeupdate.net/win10ue/), and sets it to full screen.
I just rewrote [this script](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---Fake-Update-screen) for the USB Rubber Ducky, so that it works with AHK.
I have included a few of the links in the script but if you want to use something else you can find all of the fake updates [here](https://fakeupdate.net/).
